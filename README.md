🎥 Netflix Clone

Welcome to my Netflix Clone project! This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to recreate the popular streaming platform Netflix, showcasing my skills in front-end development.

🔧 Technologies Used:
- HTML5: Used to structure the content and layout of the web pages.
- CSS3: Used for styling the application and creating an appealing user interface.
- JavaScript: Implemented dynamic functionality and interactivity, such as fetching data and creating responsive components.

🌟 Key Features:
- User Authentication: Implemented user registration and login functionality to provide a personalized experience.
- Movie Carousel: Created a responsive carousel to showcase a selection of movies and TV shows.
- Search Functionality: Implemented a search feature that allows users to search for their favorite movies and shows.
- Video Player: Built a custom video player with play, pause, and seek functionality to replicate the Netflix streaming experience.

📁 Project Structure:
- index.html: The main entry point of the application.
- styles.css: Contains the styles and layout for the application.
- script.js: Handles the dynamic functionality and user interactions.
